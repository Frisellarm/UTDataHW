    "Three observable trends that I found after analyzing the math and reading scores data:\n",
    "* In terms of school type, charter schools' scores were higher than district schools' scores in every category (with an overall % passing rate of 95.1% compared to 73.67% for district schools). This could be due to the curriculum of the charter schools and the knowledge level of the students that attend charter schools versus district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In terms of school size, small (less than 1000 students) and medium (1000-2000 students) size schools had nearly the same percentage of scores (around 95%) and were much higher than large size schools (greater than 2000 students) which had overall % passing rate of 76.36%. This could support the theory that much larger sized schools have more difficulty accomodating learning for students.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In terms of spending ranges per student, the data showed that the highest amount of spending per student actually yielded the lowest % of passing test scores (73.6%) compared to spending range of less than $615 which had an overall passing rate of 95 percent. Charter schools tend to have lower number of students than district schools therefore charter schools spending range per student would be less than district schools. \n",
